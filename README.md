# AI-Powered Agriculture Assistance
This project aims to revolutionize agricultural practices by leveraging advanced AI techniques to provide personalized recommendations and insights to farmers. Developed as a major project during our BTech studies with a team of five members, our goal is to optimize farming practices and improve crop yield through the use of machine learning chatbots and real-time data analysis.

## Features
- Crop Recommendation Chatbot: Utilizes machine learning algorithms to recommend suitable crops based on factors such as soil type, climate conditions, and historical data.
- Yield Prediction Chatbot: Predicts crop yield using advanced statistical models, helping farmers plan and manage their harvests more effectively.
- General Agricultural Assistance Chatbot: Provides general agricultural advice and assistance using AI-powered natural language understanding (NLU) capabilities.
- Streamlit Integration: All three chatbots are seamlessly integrated into a web interface using Streamlit, providing farmers with easy access to real-time guidance and insights.
- React Website: The web interface is developed using React, ensuring a user-friendly experience for farmers accessing the AI-powered assistance.
